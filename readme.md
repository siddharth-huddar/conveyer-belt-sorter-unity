## 📖 Overview

This project simulates an **automated conveyor belt sorting system** using **Unity 3D**, where cuboidal parts are sorted first by **size** and then by **color**.  
It demonstrates the application of **AR/VR technologies** in manufacturing automation and serves as a foundation for **digital twin** environments in smart factories.

The simulation integrates:
- Rigidbody physics for realistic motion  
- Trigger-based virtual sensors for sorting logic  
- Multi-stage automation (size → color)  
- Interactive visualization suitable for AR/VR systems

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design and simulate a **two-stage sorting process** (by size and color).  
- Implement **physics-based sorting logic** using Unity Rigidbody and triggers.  
- Visualize industrial workflows in **AR/VR-compatible environments**.  
- Provide a learning tool for **smart manufacturing and automation** concepts.
